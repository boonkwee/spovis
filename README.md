**SPOVis (aka SharePoint Online Visualization)**

This is a python GUI app that will consolidate data from various Excel sources in several SharePoint libraries, pull into one central Excel workbook, and perform some data cleansing, transformation. Subsequently a Data Analyst can pull the data from the consolidated source and present the data with minimal transformation using Data Visualization tools such as Pygwalker, Tableau or Power BI.

The main processing engine is in SPOVis_engine.py, and the main application entry point is SPOVis_gui.py.

The Application did not progress to the stage of compiling to .exe file. As the end-user of this application will run the .py file directly and the User's working environment does not permit the use of .exe file.
